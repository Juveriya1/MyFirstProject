        <h1>Non Semantic Elements:-</h1> Traditionally, developers have implemented non-semantic elements
		with a class attribute to define the structure and express the meaning of content. 
		It tells nothing about its content. The element has no special meaning at all. It represents
		its children. It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics 
		common to a group of consecutive elements.
